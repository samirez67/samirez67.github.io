We have chosen the following two objects from the Medical Manuscripts section of the Digital Library of the Middle East:

<img src="/assets/comparison.png" style="width:80%; height:50%; margin-left:10%;" />

The first object is the *“Qānūnchah fī al-ṭibb”*, which translates from Arabic to English as “Law of Medicine.” The manuscript, shortly called "Qānūnchah", is a 15th-century medical work that is an Arabic compendium divided into ten sections, covering various topics such as fundamental medical principles, anatomy, physical condition, treatment for ill patients, management of well patients, and various classes of diseases. It was most likely authored by Maḥmūd ibn Muḥammad ibn ʻUmar al-Jaghmīnī. Although the author claims to have compiled his work from extracts taken from ancient works on medicine, it is believed that he simply drew from Ibn Sīnā’s Qānūn. The work became essential and was regularly consulted, heavily studied, and even incorporated into the curricula of schools of medicine. The manuscript copies have annotations and material qualities that suggest its significance within the realm of the historical study and practice of Graeco-Islamic medicine.

 The second object that we have selected is the Arabic book *“Kitāb al-bayzarah”*, which translates to “Book of Falconry.” It is a Treatise on falconry focussing on the health and treatment of birds of prey by an unnamed author. The text is divided into two treatises (مقالتان) or parts (جزءان), each subdivided into chapters (أبواب). Treatise One is devoted to general information about birds of prey, their anatomical make-up (based on Galenic humoral pathology), physical characteristics etc. Treatise Two describes specific illnesses, their signs and treatments.

After gathering the metadata from the Digital Library of the Middle East, we compared them both on various aspects using the following table below:

As you can see from the comparison above, the metadata for the first manuscript, Qānūnchah fī al-ṭibb was generally more descriptive. we had to summarize the descriptions of the bindings, material and script as they were even longer than the ones we had mentioned. One of the cons of having such elaborate descriptions and not a very concise one is the difficulty that arises from it when it comes to formatting a short or precise search query for these items; which in this case, is tough to create. Apart from the depth in the details, the metadata of both the manuscripts have all the bases covered and provide information about all the aspects. Even though both the manuscripts are from different libraries: the first one from University of Michigan and second from the British library, their description narrative is a lot similar in how they describe the manuscript. Both manuscripts came from English based libraries so there weren't any translation issues and hence no discrepancies. One very important difference though is the author not being mentioned in the second manuscript but upon further research we realized the author could not be traced and hence it's mentioned as anonymous on all websites. 

Both objects from our sample have an extensive catalogue of metadata attached to them, as is commonly the case for such digital archives of confederated libraries. But the variance of formatting and narration of our requisite data across platforms (DLME itself and the contributor websites of respective pieces) make up for an interesting albeit slightly inconvenient circumstances. 

Kitab al-bayzarah, our 2nd sample, seems to be the more easily and readily discoverable one of the two for anyone curious enough to search it up on the web by simply typing in the name of the document, even without the special characters, on popular search engines (the result being a link to the original contributors website within the first 3 search results across popular search engines). That too despite having a rather congested and unarranged description tab. 

Qanunchah fi al-tibb - our 1st sample, on the other hand, suffers from a lack of discoverability.
The best outputs we achieved by running a search by its name, with the special character or otherwise, across popular search engines were remotely related documents and manuscripts, or simply different copies of the same category, from across different digital archives. None of them were the ones we were working with.
Unlike our 2nd sample, it does have neatly arranged and categorized metadata in terms of its description but it does suffer from a lack of unique identifier in its metadata, a key component and metadata for any sort of further research or analysis. This further hinders the experiment as it cannot be put into present Mirador for comparative analysis for the same aforementioned reasons. 

There is a lot to take away from this study. For one, metadata is critical to the discoverability of cultural objects in federated digital libraries. It serves as a bridge between the physical object and the digital representation of that object, providing information about its creator, subject, format, and other relevant details. Metadata allows users to search, browse, and filter digital collections, which is essential to finding the resources they need.

Incomplete metadata can have a significant impact on the discoverability of cultural objects. For example, if an object is missing key metadata, such as its creator or date, it may not show up in search results or may be difficult to find among other similar objects. Additionally, inconsistent or inaccurate metadata can lead to confusion or errors when using digital libraries. Something that became evident during our work with the Qanunchah fi al-tibb.

The lack of a properly organized information present in the metadata of Kitab al-bayzarah, our 2nd sample, was more than made up for in the comprehensive and structured metadata in its original contributors website; fleshed with all the relevant metadata one might deem necessary for further analysis of the piece. 
Qanunchah fi al-tibb, on the other hand, struggles from a lack of a unique identifier from both the DLME and its contributor website (University of Michigan). Something that causes further issues as the ones we addressed earlier.

All being said, metadata too comes at a cost. Though it varies depending on the size and complexity of the collection, as well as the resources available for creating and maintaining metadata, it is safe to say that the objects of our sample fall on the south end of the cost and complexity spectrum for the nature of it. Creating high-quality metadata can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, requiring skilled staff and specialized tools. However, the cost of metadata can be reduced through the use of automated tools and crowdsourcing, which can help to streamline the process and make it more cost-effective.

To make metadata better, it is important to invest in creating high-quality metadata at the outset of a project and to maintain it over time. This requires a commitment to standards and best practices for metadata creation and management, as well as ongoing training and support for staff involved in metadata creation. Additionally, it is important to involve end-users in the process of creating metadata, as they can provide valuable insights and feedback on the usability and effectiveness of the metadata.
