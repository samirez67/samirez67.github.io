As a 21-year-old university student, I am excited to be taking an introductory course in Digital Humanities. I am constantly engaging with technology in all aspects of my daily and academic life, using various platforms and software for content creation, social interaction, research data management, and data analysis.

While I consider myself proficient in using these technologies, I realize that my understanding of their utilities is limited. I want to take this course to gain a deeper understanding of the role that technology plays in shaping our society and culture.

As an avid content creator, I use platforms like Canva, Adobe Creative Suite, and Microsoft Office to design and edit graphics, videos, and documents. Social media platforms like Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook are integral to my social life, and I use them to connect with friends and family, share my work, and engage with communities of interest.

For academic research, I rely on software like Zotero, NVivo, and Excel to manage and analyze data. While I am proficient in using these tools, I want to learn more about their capabilities and limitations, and how they fit into the broader context of digital technologies.

In this course, I am discovering the ways in which digital technologies shape our understanding of the world and how they impact our personal and professional lives. I am learning about the history of computing, the principles of human-centered design, and the ethical considerations that come with digital technology.

Moving forward, I am excited to continue exploring these topics and to develop the critical thinking skills necessary to assess the impact of technology on society and culture. I hope to gain a deeper understanding of how technology can be used to create positive change in the world, and to develop the skills necessary to navigate the complex and rapidly changing digital landscape.

## Why should I use a static website?
A static website, simply put, is easier to manage than just about any other option out there for a simple website. Since it does not rely on any additional web application, it can be hosted on any webhosting server. It does not require regular updates like many dynamic websites such as WordPress or Drupal require. Everything that the website needs to work is contained within one directory, making it incredibly easy to move.
